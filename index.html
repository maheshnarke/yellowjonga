why it will change the game

More features than rivals: Along with email, texts and phone calls, Apple says its watch will present news, health readings and other notifications in creative ways that can be read at a glance. It will have a heart rate monitor and accelerometer, and an internal motor that can signal the wearer with a subtle "tap" on the wrist. And Siri and Apple Pay will be built in. Apple is working with outside companies to create more apps; Cook has talked about using the watch as an electronic "key" for hotel doors or even cars.

A powerful brand: The world's biggest tech company has a reputation for quality and a direct conduit to customers - it operates more than 400 retail stores around the world. And it has deep pockets to spend on advertising - it is showcasing the watch this month with a sleek, 12-page insert in Vogue and other fashion magazines.

Apple's track record: This wouldn't be the first Apple product that revolutionized a market where rivals had struggled to break through. Other companies made digital music players before the iPod, smartphones before the iPhone and even tablets before the iPad. Most of those products failed to catch on until Apple made devices so appealing they set new standards and created new demand, said Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder.
